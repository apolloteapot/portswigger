<!-- Unintended solution:
Start the lab "Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded" at the same time.
Post a comment with sthe same XSS payload as below.
For the exploit, simply redirect the victim to the page with the stored XSS.
Since the two labs are same-site, the cookies will be sent. -->
